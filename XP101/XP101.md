### XP 101

* XP stands for 'eXtreme Programming' and takes good software engineering practices to the extreme limits
* Contributors to this material include Kent Beck, Ken Auer and Don Wells

### XP Structure

XP's structure consists of Goals, Activies, Values, Rules, Principles and Practices. The Practices are the most concrete. Therefore we focus on them.

### XP activities

XP describes the following team activities: Listening, Designing, Coding and Testing.
* Coding: as is written in the agile manifesto, working software is the true valuable product. Code can also be an effective communication medium between developers and working software contributes in understanding the product and its requirements.
  - N.B. functional analysis and stakeholder alignment is not part of XP and needs to be added if needed.

* Testing: the original XP advocates end-of-day integration testing. This led to an abundance of stubs to create working, yet useless system increments. All levels of testing need to be developed up front (A)TDD (acceptance)test driven development. The TDD forces team members and/or the PM to describe the 'what' (given ... when ... then) before development starts.

* Designing: Code only provides short term speed, but a certain aligned code structure helps the team to work even more efficient. Designing in XP is the minimum amount of structure to avoid mid term (forseeable) refactoring. Everything that helps to collaborate more effectively, like code patterns, naming conventions, is part of this design
  - N.B. Architecture is not part of XP, i.e. the longer term impact analysis and heavy impact decisions need to follow classical architecting processes, like RCDA.

* Listening: the team needs to listen to its stakeholders. This listening typically takes place in moments of feedback (planned feedback or unplanned feedback via incidents, questions, problems)

### Practices
The Practices are welldescribed on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming_practices) and only summarized here


### Fine scale feedback

|                   |                                                                                  | 
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| Pair Programming | Taking code review to the extreme: continuously reviewing code by the 'navigator' |
| Planning Game | The planning is elaborated further into 'release planning'  every 13 weeks and _iteration planning_ (every 1 week). Planning consists of Exploration, Commitment and Steering | 
| Test Driven Development | TDD is applicable for all levels of testing, unit, integation and system testing. Which is a splendid setup for DevOps | 
| Whole Team | The principle is that the team has the customer at hand at all times|

### Continuous process
|                   |                                                                                  | 
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| Continuous Integration | The latest and greatest version of the software always works, that means that integration better is done in small increments without breaking the build, the integration and all test levels. Only by frequent integrations, the team treats integration a business as usual and integration problems stay small and manageble |
| Design Improvement| The 'simple design' rule inevitable causes design changes and refactoring. Improve the design when needed |
| Small Releases    | as mentioned above keep deployment changes small and frequent |

### Shared understanding
|                   |                                                                                  | 
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| Coding standard   |  coding standards codify the wisdom of senior programmers to teach starting developers. They also resolve any fashion conflicts by choosing the patterns and constructs, such that code sprawl is avoided. Clean readable code improves quality and reduces defect injection | 
| Collective code ownership | every team member owns all the code. This includes: fix it when it breaks (eliminate waiting times), clean it up when you encounter violations and/or code smells |
| Simple design     | simple means clear, readable |
| system metaphor   | choose method and function names based on the business problem at hand. The product owner/manager must be able to read the code if names directly relate to business terminology |

### Programmer welfare
|                   |                                                                                  | 
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| Sustainable pace  | Don't do overtime. Overtime and work stress cause introduction of mistakes that result in additional overtime to be solved. |
